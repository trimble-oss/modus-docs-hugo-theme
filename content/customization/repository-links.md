Modus Docs supports linking to GitHub or Bitbucket repositories. This is done by adding a `repository` key to the front matter of a page. The value of the `repository` key is a URL to the repository. For example:

```yaml
params:
  GitHubRepo: "https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-docs-hugo-theme"
```
